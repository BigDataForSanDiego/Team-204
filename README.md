#### Hackathon Five CORE Themes.
- [ ] Access to care
> How can we make it easier to access care (especially specialists) and provide clear, timely notifications, and reminders along their healthcare journey?
- [ ] Patient satisfaction
> How can we make it more convenient for patients to provide real-time feedback about their healthcare experience through a mobile app?

> As a potential new customer, how can we leverage the mobile app to help new patients better understand what services are available to them?
- [X] Managing my health
> It's easy to get overwhelmed by all the tasks patients often have to do to maintain their health, how can we make managing health more enjoyable?
- [ ] Addressing mental health challenges
> Mental health challenges may be difficult to identify and have a broad impact on health, how can we help clinicians be more in tune with patients mental health needs?

> How can big (geospatial) data analytics and AI be used to improve access to information about the influence of human behavior, cultural practices, and social interactions on the spread of diseases?
